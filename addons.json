This makes testing your changes easier.","fullDescription":"This is a tool for extension developers tired of the usual test cycle: make a change, create a new extension build, install it in the browser (with wait time and confirmations), restart the browser, test. This extension will receive new extension packages on a TCP port, automatically install them and restart the browser if necessary. All you need to do is send your extension package to this port, e.g. with the wget command line tool:\n\nwget --post-file=extension.xpi http://127.0.0.1:8888/\n\nOr with the curl command line tool (removing Expect header here is important):\n\ncurl --data-binary '@extension.xpi' -H 'Expect:' http://127.0.0.1:8888/\n\nIt will be even simpler if you integrate this step into the build script of your extension. Note: The response to this request is always \"500 No Content\" to prevent the command line tools from saving results, this is not an issue.\n\nConfiguration\n\nBy default, the extension will accept connections on port 8888 with 127.0.0.1 (localhost) as the only address allowed to connect. Connection attempts from other IP addresses will show up in Error Console. To accept connections from other addresses add them to the \"Accept IP addresses\" options field. If you do that please keep in mind that IP addresses can be spoofed on unprotected networks (e.g. public WiFi).\n\nFirefox Mobile notes\n\nYou can also test your extension on a mobile phone while developing on your desktop, simply send the extension package to the IP address of your phone instead of localhost. You have to configure Auto-Installer on your phone however and add the IP address of your desktop to the allowed addresses.\n\nKnown issues\n\n    Your firewall might ask you about allowing incoming connections even if 127.0.0.1 is the only allowed IP address.\n    No connections will be accepted after switching the browser into offline mode and back, Extension Auto-Installer needs to be restarted.\n\n\nSource code / Contributing\n\nThe extension source code is available under https://github.com/palant/autoinstaller.","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/66/66680.png?src=api&modified=1326518563","width":"700","height":"318","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/66/66680.png?src=api&modified=1326518563","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"90"}],"averageRating":5,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/autoinstaller/?src=api","homepageURL":"https://github.com/palant/autoinstaller","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/503112/extension_auto_installer-1.3-sm+an+fx+tb.xpi?src=api","size":15821,"developerComments":null,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/autoinstaller/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":49,"totalDownloads":291251,"weeklyDownloads":49,"dailyUsers":1884,"updateDate":1473954932000,"supportURL":"https://github.com/palant/autoinstaller/issues"},{"id":"jid1-KLw59UduPgRwag@jetpack","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/530/530404-32.png?modified=1406175628","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/530/530404-64.png?modified=1406175628"},"name":"Browsing Activity Tracker","type":"extension","version":"0.1.1-signed.1-signed","repositoryStatus":4,"creator":{"name":"Thibaut","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/user/Thibauth/?src=api"},"description":"Notify a callback URL whenever a webpage is loaded or displayed.","fullDescription":"This extension provides a flexible way to log your browsing activity. In particular, it allows you to track how much time you spend on websites. The approach is minimalistic and give you direct access to the raw browsing data that you can then analyze and aggregate to your taste.\n\nIn contrast, other extensions with the same purpose often require that you create an account on their website and store your browsing data. Furthermore, they only give you access to an automatically generated report with very little control over how it is produced.\n\nThe extension notifies a callback URL by sending an HTTP POST request whenever one the following events occur:\n\n    a browser window is activated (gains focus)\n    a tab is activated\n    a webpage is loaded (when you follow a link, or navigate through your history)\n    a browser window is deactivated (loses focus)\n\n\nThe body of the POST request is a JSON object containing the following keys:\n\n    title: Title of the webpage (typically the content of the <title> tag)\n    url: URL of the webpage\n    time: Time at which the event occurred. Number of milliseconds elapsed since 1 January 1970 00:00:00 UTC\n    key: A key identifying the browser sending the request\n    favicon: The URL of the webpage's favicon (or null when there is no favicon)\n\n\nFor window deactivation events, all the keys except for the time key are set to null.","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/139/139350.png?src=api&modified=1405435589","width":"700","height":"438","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/139/139350.png?src=api&modified=1405435589","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"125"}],"averageRating":5,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/browsing-activity-tracker/?src=api","homepageURL":"https://github.com/Thibauth/browsing-activity-tracker","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/267080/browsing_activity_tracker-0.1-fx.xpi?src=api","size":42245,"developerComments":null,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/browsing-activity-tracker/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":1,"totalDownloads":573,"weeklyDownloads":0,"dailyUsers":10,"updateDate":1406174047000,"supportURL":null},{"id":"{B17C1C5A-04B1-11DB-9804-B622A1EF5492}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/2/2848-32.png?modified=1506956968","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/2/2848-64.png?modified=1506956968"},"name":"Password Exporter","type":"extension","version":"1.3.4","repositoryStatus":4,"creator":{"name":"Justin Scott (fligtar)","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/user/fligtar/?src=api"},"developers":[{"name":"Jorge Villalobos","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/user/jorge-villalobos/?src=api"}],"description":"This add-on allows you to export your saved passwords and disabled login hosts using XML or CSV files that can be imported later.\n\nNote: This add-on won't work in Firefox 57.
